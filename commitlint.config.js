// Enforces Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) on every commit in a PR.
// Standard types only (feat, fix, docs, chore, ci, test, refactor, build, ...) - no custom
// type-enum, so this stays generic across whatever content this template is used for. Scope is
// optional and free-form; see CONTRIBUTING.md for the scopes this repo's own convention suggests.
//
// No `ignores` rule for git-subrepo's own commits: `git subrepo clone/pull/push` all accept
// -m/--message and it fully replaces the tool's auto-generated message (verified directly - see
// creation-guidelines/tad-engine's README). Always pass -m with a real Conventional Commits
// message (see .tad/README.md and AGENTS.md); if commitlint ever flags a subrepo sync commit,
// that means -m was forgotten, and the fix is to amend the message, not to exempt the pattern.
